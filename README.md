## Objectives

After recently learning about HTML canvas in my last project, [*Drawma*](https://github.com/elizabetholsavsky/drawma), I was motivatged to apply these skills to create a simple JavaScript game. Since I do not have any prior experience creating a JavaScript game, I decided to get the ball rolling with this tutorial. While this specific game does not include canvas, it does demonstrate a lot of basic game functionality that will be useful to reference in the future when I am creating my own game.
